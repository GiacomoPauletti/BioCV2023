# BioCV2023
This repository contains my solution for Biomedical Image Segmentation CHAOS 2015 challenge.
I am focusing on task 5:
> "Segmentation of abdominal organs (MRI only): The same task given in "Task 3" but extended to four abdominal organs; liver, kidneys, spleen. In this task, ensemble or fusion of individual systems between MR sequences (i.e. two models, one working on T1-DUAL and the other on  T2-SPIR ) are allowed" ([CHAOS challenge](https://chaos.grand-challenge.org/))

Until now I wrote a partial solution, in which I'm segmenting the abdominal organs only for T1-DUAL sequence, but I'm planning to solve it also for T2-SPIR sequence.  
  
General information:
* All models are adapted versions of U-Net model.  
* Main library used are tensorflow, keras and PIL

WORK IN PROGRESS... ⚠️
